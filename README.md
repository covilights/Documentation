## CoviLights
CoviLights is a project to create a GDPR compliant contact tracing app for Covid-19 contact tracing purposes. 

## Motivation
When the peak of COVID-19 cases is overcome, effective contact tracing is thought to be an important element of maintaining infections at a low level. By providing effective contact tracing, smartphone apps can be part of exit strategies.

Since COVID-19 does not stop at borders, we believe such contact tracing should be a truly open, global project. But since many users will be based in the EU, we also want to make it GDPR compliant, and offer that data protection "gold standard" to all users.
